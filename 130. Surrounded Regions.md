# Method 1 : DFS
May cause StackOverFlow Error

This is a DFS solution, but it may causes a stack overflow issue.

When you use DFS, it is tricky to use:

        if(i>1)
            check(vec,i-1,j,row,col);
        if(j>1)
            check(vec,i,j-1,row,col);
because it is more common to write like this:

        if(i>=1)
            check(vec,i-1,j,row,col);
        if(j>=1)
            check(vec,i,j-1,row,col);
Then I'll explain it.

There is a test case like this:

OOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXO
OOOOOOOOOO
OXXXXXXXXX
OOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXO
OOOOOOOOOO
OXXXXXXXXX
OOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXO
To make it clear, I draw a 10x10 board, but it is actually a 250x250 board like this one.

When dfs function visit board[0][0], it ought to visit every grid marked 'O', thus lead to stack overflow(runtime error).

After you change "if(j>=1)" to "if(j>1)", the DFS function won't check board[i][0] (0<=i<=row-1), and then not all the grids marked 'O' will be visited when you dfs(board[0][0]).
Your code won't cause stack overflow in this test case, but if we change the test case a little, it won't work well.

Consider a test case like this:

OOOOOOOOOOOX
XXXXXXXXXXOX
XOOOOOOOOOOX
XOXXXXXXXXXX
XOOOOOOOOOOX
XXXXXXXXXXOX
XOOOOOOOOOOX
XOXXXXXXXXXX
XOOOOOOOOOOX
XXXXXXXXXXOX
I draw a 10x12 board, but it may be as large as the 250x250 board.

I believe that your code will get "runtime error" in this test case when tested in Leetcode system.
